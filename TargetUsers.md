## Jeff
- Name: 		Jeff Gorden
- Age: 			34
- Skills:		Fathering, brainstorming, learning
- Interests:	playing rugby, knowledge of any kind, learn-forms, reading books
- Desc:			Jeff is a married father of two little girls. In his freetime he likes to learn about any topic he is just interested in right in that time.
		For doing this he surfs a lot in the web and often finds interesting articles he would like to remember to read again later or for looking something up again.
		He would like to have a system where he can remember the links and link them to serveral words under which he would search the article later.
		
## Kim
- Name: 		Kim Paramond
- Age: 			29
- Skills:		Document processing, biologic analatics, networking
- interests:	Biology, Philisophy, Swimming, reading scientific documents, writing abstracts
- Desc:			Kim is working in a laboratory of biologic science. In her work he has to read a lot of studies and other knowledge documents. Many of these documents are printed.
		Kim likes to scan the documents and save them on her computer for archiving purposes. But her archive is becoming huge and messy. Because of the hierachial folder-
		structure she has, many documents are placed in one branch but often would fit also in other branches. When she looks for a document she often has to lookup multiple
		branches until she finds the right document. To avoid this she looks for a non-hierachial system to link all the documents under serveral keywords to find them faster.
		
## Fred
- Name: 		Fred Kalkbrenner
- Age: 			25
- Skills:		Analytical and logical thinking, abstract imagination, learning languages
- Interests:	Skydiving, gardening, software developpment, algorithms
- Desc:	Fred is a programmer. His skills are shared over a lot of programming languages and he works in many different projects. His knowledge is on one hand learning by doing
		and on the other hand learning by googling. So a lot of his knowledge he learned by forums and ask-and-question-pages. To recall a solution to a problem he started saving
		text-files of the links to find them later on again. Because a textfile isn't very dynamic he needs another system to save all his links with keywords to the web so he can find his solutions more rapidly. Additional he would like to have the system to propose him used keywords to his links so he doesn't always save synonyms of the keywords.
